										<p>On paper, my family seems to be solid in middle class. My father graduated with a master’s degree in management from Seoul National University, the most prestigious university in Korea. My mother also went to the Ewha Womans University which is well-known as the Smith College of Korea.<br /><br />
										However, life was tough. We lost everything, including our house and all our savings because of the so-called IMF financial crisis in Korea. During the crisis, my father’s workplace, a securities company, went bankrupt when he was 41. However, he did not give up and has paid the debt for over 20 years. My mother who was a career housewife until then started working at a small restaurant when she was almost 40. She was a mathematician, who graduated from one of the woman leading school in Korea. However, she had to spend over 20 years of her life teaching simple arithmetic to elementary students.</p>

								<p>Thus, due to this background, I had to be on my own since the age of 18. I had to go to Japan because of my family’s financial difficulty. This was the only way I could go to a college because I received a scholarship for my undergraduate studies at Yokohama National University from the Korean and Japanese governments, which provided living expenses and tuition waiver as well. When I went to Japan to study, I did not speak any Japanese and I struggled to keep up with courses conducted in Japanese. However, with hard work and sincere efforts, I could overcome these challenges and now I can speak fluent Japanese. In addition, I could secure a scholarship for my master’s studies at the University of Tokyo.<br /><br />
								Those were painful and everything changed. However, I think this shaped me in good ways. I am grateful for what I have today because I saw how my parents overcame through hard work and persistency when life must have been tough for them. Because of their grit and persistence, we could become stable once again. I think that taught me to continue to dream despite the reality. I have never lost my dream of becoming a world-class scientist. No matter how challengint it was, I kept on because I have had a dream since my childhood. When I was in a kindergarten, my mother said that I drew a painting of myself receiving the Nobel Prize. Even though that was a long time ago, I have been still the same person now as well as at that time I chose physics as my major. While the Nobel Prize is a great honor my dream is not just a prize. It is my way to give back because I am where I am today thanks to many helps in my life, like the governmental scholarship. I owe it to others, so as a scientist I really want to help people. Not only I have done volunteer activities to help less fortunate neighbors, but also, I strongly believe in the power of condensed matter physics and applied science, which hold implications for any field of science and technology.<br /><br />
								I love to do research and I think the numbers show that. For example, I have published 12 papers in peer-reviewed journals, of which 8 are SCI(E) journals. It is my passion and going to a lab did not feel like work because I was doing what I love. In addition, my recent workplace has 200 employees. It is relatively small, but it is very diverse. Because it is a central research for advanced engineering, there were all kinds of engineers. I see the value of diversity and it is amazing to see how even for one same topic five people can come up with five different solutions. It is exciting to do teamwork and have discussions with diverse people. I know your school is going to be much more diverse and I look forward to it. In many ways, I got trained with diversity because I went to school in Japan when I was fully-grown. I was the only international student in the Physics division at Yokohama National University, but I adapted well. I hope to continue my research in physics and apply my full curiosity, passion, and capacity for research.</p>

									<h2>Research Interests</h2>
								</header>
								<p>My research interests are in the field of condensed matter and applied physics, including theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches to macroscopic quantum phenomena and novel functional materials.<br /><br />
								During my undergraduate studies, I was fascinated by first-principles approaches to condensed matter physics because of my interest in the theoretical study of experimentally observed phenomena via numerous computational calculations based on quantum mechanics. I ultimately chose this topic for my undergraduate research and studied the fundamentals of first-principles calculations under the guidance of Professor Kaoru Ohno. I joined the project on developing the Tohoku Mixed-Basis Orbitals ab-initio program (TOMBO), which is an efficient all-electron mixed-basis code for density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. TOMBO exploits both plane waves and atomic orbitals (mixed-basis) for normal DFT calculations and high-level GW calculations (one-shot and self-consistent GW) based on many-body perturbation theories. While working to improve TOMBO, I also performed several calculations using other DFT packages. In the course of my studies and my work on the TOMBO project, I became aware of the gap between theoretical and experimental physics, and I eventually decided to expand my interest in condensed matter physics to include experimental observations.<br /><br />
								Based on my new desire to participate in experimental studies, I joined Professor Shuji Hasegawa’s physics laboratory at the University of Tokyo for my master’s degree studies. Here, I investigated surface states using the instruments such as a scanning tunneling microscopes (STMs) and micro-four-point probes in ultrahigh vacuum to study diverse phenomena, including the Kondo effect, Rashba effect, weak anti-localization, superconductivity, topological insulators, and silicene. The study on weak anti-localization was published in Physical Review Letters. Subsequently, dilute magnetic surface systems became my focus area as I explored the interactions between surface two-dimensional (2D) electron states and magnetic atoms. I performed surface-sensitive and temperature-dependent resistivity measurements on a dilute magnetic surface, for example, Si(111)–√7×√3-In surfaces with adsorbed Co atoms, to examine 2D Kondo effects and Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida (RKKY) interactions.<br /><br />
								In addition to my condensed matter physics studies, I have studied applied science, which is closely connected to human life. I joined the Institute for Advanced Engineering (IAE) as a ‘Technical Research Personnel’. During my five years at IAE, I designed, planned, and performed various research projects in the fields of applied physics and chemistry, materials science, and environmental engineering, all of which were completely new challenges and provided opportunities to widen my intellectual horizons by applying what I had studied. In addition, I gained a wealth of experience as the main practitioner in projects, leading team members, collaborating with other institutes, and handling administrative tasks such as budget management. My research at IAE mainly involved the synthesis and application of nanomaterials, such as nanoparticles of refractory metals and oxides, and recovery and upcycling of valuable resources from industrial waste, such as batteries and displays. I published 11 research articles in peer-reviewed journals based on these studies.<br /><br />
								With all of my experiences in both experiments and theories, I have come to believe that theoretical approaches using computational power together with experiments present dramatic potential synergies for unveiling many physical phenomena and their mechanisms. Every time I analyzed my experiment results, I had doubts on whether they were truly attributable to the factors I had considered as the mechanisms responsible for the phenomenon. I repeatedly wondered how theoretical and computational approaches could offer convincing mechanisms for experimental observation and elucidate phenomena. With this emerging curiosity and enthusiasm, I hope to study theoretical, computational, and experimental condensed matter physics for my Ph.D. degree. I believe that a theoretical investigation of the 2D Kondo effect and RKKY interaction through a quantitative analysis on the effect of magnetic adatoms in combination with experiments will contribute greatly to the field. Moreover, magnetic atoms adsorbed on superconducting surfaces, such as In-induced and Pb-induced structures on Si(111) could be studied in terms of the effects of a competition between the superconductivity and Kondo effect. 2D topological superconductivity in Pb/Co/Si has recently been reported, which was fabricated by combining a 2D Rashba superconductor with magnetic impurities. This system would also be an intriguing subject. The low-dimensional phenomena have been actively studied by a great number of theoretical and experimental physicists around the world. I have developed a strong passion to study the field of quantum phenomena in low-dimensional materials. Furthermore, due to my experiences at IAE, I am interested in theoretical and experimental studies on novel functional materials, including on photocatalytic materials for energy and environmental applications.</p>
