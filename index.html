										<p>On paper, my family seems to be solid in middle class. My father graduated with a master’s degree in management from Seoul National University, the most prestigious university in Korea. My mother also went to the Ewha Womans University which is well-known as the Smith College of Korea.<br>
											<h6><br></h6>
										However, life was tough. We lost everything, including our house and all our savings because of the so-called IMF financial crisis in Korea. During the crisis, my father’s workplace, a securities company, went bankrupt when he was 41. However, he did not give up and has paid the debt for over 20 years. My mother who was a career housewife until then started working at a small restaurant when she was almost 40. She was a mathematician, who graduated from one of the woman leading school in Korea. However, she had to spend over 20 years of her life teaching simple arithmetic to elementary students.</p>
									</div>
									<span class="image"><img src="https://sdyadphd.github.io/images/photo01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								</div>
								<h6><br></h6>
								<p>Thus, due to this background, I had to be on my own since the age of 18. I had to go to Japan because of my family’s financial difficulty. This was the only way I could go to a college because I received a scholarship for my undergraduate studies at Yokohama National University from the Korean and Japanese governments, which provided living expenses and tuition waiver as well. When I went to Japan to study, I did not speak any Japanese and I struggled to keep up with courses conducted in Japanese. However, with hard work and sincere efforts, I could overcome these challenges and now I can speak fluent Japanese. In addition, I could secure a scholarship for my master’s studies at the University of Tokyo.<br>
									<h6><br></h6>
								Those were painful and everything changed. However, I think this shaped me in good ways. I am grateful for what I have today because I saw how my parents overcame through hard work and persistency when life must have been tough for them. Because of their grit and persistence, we could become stable once again. I think that taught me to continue to dream despite the reality. I have never lost my dream of becoming a world-class scientist. No matter how challengint it was, I kept on because I have had a dream since my childhood. When I was in a kindergarten, my mother said that I drew a painting of myself receiving the Nobel Prize. Even though that was a long time ago, I have been still the same person now as well as at that time I chose physics as my major. While the Nobel Prize is a great honor my dream is not just a prize. It is my way to give back because I am where I am today thanks to many helps in my life, like the governmental scholarship. I owe it to others, so as a scientist I really want to help people. Not only I have done volunteer activities to help less fortunate neighbors, but also, I strongly believe in the power of condensed matter physics and applied science, which hold implications for any field of science and technology.<br>
								<h6><br></h6>
								I love to do research and I think the numbers show that. For example, I have published 12 papers in peer-reviewed journals, of which 8 are SCI(E) journals. It is my passion and going to a lab did not feel like work because I was doing what I love. In addition, my recent workplace has 200 employees. It is relatively small, but it is very diverse. Because it is a central research for advanced engineering, there were all kinds of engineers. I see the value of diversity and it is amazing to see how even for one same topic five people can come up with five different solutions. It is exciting to do teamwork and have discussions with diverse people. I know your school is going to be much more diverse and I look forward to it. In many ways, I got trained with diversity because I went to school in Japan when I was fully-grown. I was the only international student in the Physics division at Yokohama National University, but I adapted well. I hope to continue my research in physics and apply my full curiosity, passion, and capacity for research.</p>

									<h2>Research Interests</h2>
								</header>
								<p>My research interests are in the field of condensed matter and applied physics, including theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches to macroscopic quantum phenomena and novel functional materials.<br>
									<h6><br></h6>
								During my undergraduate studies, I was fascinated by first-principles approaches to condensed matter physics because of my interest in the theoretical study of experimentally observed phenomena via numerous computational calculations based on quantum mechanics. I ultimately chose this topic for my undergraduate research and studied the fundamentals of first-principles calculations under the guidance of Professor Kaoru Ohno. I joined the project on developing the Tohoku Mixed-Basis Orbitals ab-initio program (TOMBO), which is an efficient all-electron mixed-basis code for density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. TOMBO exploits both plane waves and atomic orbitals (mixed-basis) for normal DFT calculations and high-level GW calculations (one-shot and self-consistent GW) based on many-body perturbation theories. While working to improve TOMBO, I also performed several calculations using other DFT packages. In the course of my studies and my work on the TOMBO project, I became aware of the gap between theoretical and experimental physics, and I eventually decided to expand my interest in condensed matter physics to include experimental observations.<br>
								<h6><br></h6>
								Based on my new desire to participate in experimental studies, I joined Professor Shuji Hasegawa’s physics laboratory at the University of Tokyo for my master’s degree studies. Here, I investigated surface states using the instruments such as a scanning tunneling microscopes (STMs) and micro-four-point probes in ultrahigh vacuum to study diverse phenomena, including the Kondo effect, Rashba effect, weak anti-localization, superconductivity, topological insulators, and silicene. The study on weak anti-localization was published in Physical Review Letters. Subsequently, dilute magnetic surface systems became my focus area as I explored the interactions between surface two-dimensional (2D) electron states and magnetic atoms. I performed surface-sensitive and temperature-dependent resistivity measurements on a dilute magnetic surface, for example, Si(111)–√7×√3-In surfaces with adsorbed Co atoms, to examine 2D Kondo effects and Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida (RKKY) interactions.<br>
								<h6><br></h6>
								In addition to my condensed matter physics studies, I have studied applied science, which is closely connected to human life. I joined the Institute for Advanced Engineering (IAE) as a ‘Technical Research Personnel’. During my five years at IAE, I designed, planned, and performed various research projects in the fields of applied physics and chemistry, materials science, and environmental engineering, all of which were completely new challenges and provided opportunities to widen my intellectual horizons by applying what I had studied. In addition, I gained a wealth of experience as the main practitioner in projects, leading team members, collaborating with other institutes, and handling administrative tasks such as budget management. My research at IAE mainly involved the synthesis and application of nanomaterials, such as nanoparticles of refractory metals and oxides, and recovery and upcycling of valuable resources from industrial waste, such as batteries and displays. I published 11 research articles in peer-reviewed journals based on these studies.<br>
								<h6><br></h6>
								With all of my experiences in both experiments and theories, I have come to believe that theoretical approaches using computational power together with experiments present dramatic potential synergies for unveiling many physical phenomena and their mechanisms. Every time I analyzed my experiment results, I had doubts on whether they were truly attributable to the factors I had considered as the mechanisms responsible for the phenomenon. I repeatedly wondered how theoretical and computational approaches could offer convincing mechanisms for experimental observation and elucidate phenomena. With this emerging curiosity and enthusiasm, I hope to study theoretical, computational, and experimental condensed matter physics for my Ph.D. degree. I believe that a theoretical investigation of the 2D Kondo effect and RKKY interaction through a quantitative analysis on the effect of magnetic adatoms in combination with experiments will contribute greatly to the field. Moreover, magnetic atoms adsorbed on superconducting surfaces, such as In-induced and Pb-induced structures on Si(111) could be studied in terms of the effects of a competition between the superconductivity and Kondo effect. 2D topological superconductivity in Pb/Co/Si has recently been reported, which was fabricated by combining a 2D Rashba superconductor with magnetic impurities. This system would also be an intriguing subject. The low-dimensional phenomena have been actively studied by a great number of theoretical and experimental physicists around the world. I have developed a strong passion to study the field of quantum phenomena in low-dimensional materials. Furthermore, due to my experiences at IAE, I am interested in theoretical and experimental studies on novel functional materials, including on photocatalytic materials for energy and environmental applications.</p>

								<h4>&nbsp;&#8227;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Facile Synthesis of TiO<sub>2</sub>-based Photocatalysts with Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity</strong></h4>
								<div class="spotlight">
									<div class="content">
										<p style="font-size:95%">
											TiO<sub>2</sub> is an attractive catalyst for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. However, owing to its large bandgap, it can only be activated by ultra-violet light, which constitutes only a small portion (3–5%) of solar energy. Therefore, there has been significant interests in extending its light absorption range from ultra-violet to visible light. In this study, surface-fluorinated TiO<sub>2</sub> hollow spheres were prepared and then heterostructures of the surface-fluorinated TiO<sub>2</sub> hollow spheres and WO<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles were synthesized. The photocatalytic activity of the synthesized photocatalysts was evaluated under visible light irradiation, and significantly improved photocatalytic activity was observed. This is because of the synergetic effects to extend light absorption range to visible light, decrease recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and provide more active sites.<br>

								<div class="spotlight">
									<div class="content">
										<p style="font-size:95%">
											We made a new radio-frequency (RF) induction thermal plasma system. Tungsten nanoparticles were synthesized using three different precursors: commercial tungsten, tungsten oxide, and ammonium paratungstate (APT) with the RF induction thermal plasma system. The crystalline structure, morphology, and particle size of the synthesized tungsten nanoparticles were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The tungsten nanoparticles obtained using the APT was found to be the most homogeneous and smallest nanoparticles and showed the largest <i>&alpha;-W</i> phase, which is a more stable and preferred phase of tungsten because of its superior properties to those of the <i>&beta;-W</i> phase. The tungsten nanoparticles were then treated via thermochemical reduction at 600-900 &deg;C, and single-phase <i>&alpha;-W</i> nanoparticles were obtained.

								<h4>&nbsp;&#8227;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Selective Recovery from Waste LTCC and Synthesis of Sivler Nanoparticles</strong></h4>
								<div class="spotlight">
									<div class="content">
										<p style="font-size:95%">
											Waste low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) was recycled through a simple and cost-effective process. Followed by leaching optimization, silver was selectively recovered as silver chloride (AgCl) via leaching and precipitation. The precipitated AgCl also used to synthesize homogeneous and pure silver nanoparticles via a simple one-pot greener synthesis route. AgCl was dissolved in ammonium hydroxide and reduced to pure silver metal nanoparticles using hydrazine as a reductant. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was used as a stabilizer and Polyethylene glycol was (PEG) used as a reducing reagent as well as a stabilizing reagent to control the size and shape of silver nanoparticles. This recycling process is simple and easy to implement and it requires minimum facilities and no specialty chemicals.

								<h4>&nbsp;&#8227;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><i>In situ</i> Magnetotransport Measurements in Ultrathin Bi Films: Evidence for Surface-Bulk Coherent Transport</strong></h4>
								<div class="spotlight">
									<div class="content">
										<p style="font-size:95%">
											<i>In situ</i> magnetotransport measurements on ultrathin Bi(111) films [4 – 30 bilayers (BLs), 16 – 120 &#8491; thick] were performed to elucidate the role of bulk or surface states in the transport phenomena. The experiments were performed in ultrahigh vacuum with a micro-four-point-probe conductivity measurement system, in which the sample and the probe can be cooled down to 0.8 K and a magnetic field as high as 7 T can be applied perpendicular to the surface. The temperature dependence of the film conductivity showed no thickness dependence for the 6–16 BL films and was affected by the electron-electron scattering, suggesting surface-state dominant contribution. In contrast, the weak antilocalization effect observed by applying a magnetic field showed clear thickness dependence, indicating bulk transport. This apparent inconsistency is explained by a coherent bulk-surface coupling that produces a single channel transport. For the films thicker than 20 BLs, the behavior changes drastically which can likely be interpreted as a bulk dominant conduction.

									<div class="content">
										<p style="font-size:95%">
											Interactions between magnetic adatoms and surface two-dimensional electron states created at dilute magnetic surface systems, Si(111)-2√21×2√21-(Au,Mn) (0.012 ML of Mn) and Co/Si(111)-√7×√3-In (0.0005 – 0.050 ML of Co). Surface-sensitive and temperature-dependent resistivity measurements were performed <i>in situ</i> in ultrahigh vacuum via micro-four-point probe method. Sample surfaces were cooled cown from the room temperature to 20 K. In the results of experiments, Si(111)-2√21×2√21-(Au,Mn) was metallic at the room temperature, but metal-insulator transition happened at ca. 100K. In the case of Co/Si(111)-√7×√3-In, all samples were metallic from the room temperature to 20 K, and the Kondo effect and RKKY interactions were not observed. There are two possibilities for this; one is that the interactions beteewn the Co adatoms and surface electron states were too weak, and the other one is that Co adatoms gathered together and clusters were formed.
